# Password Generator
Challenge 5 - Password generator - Javascript - Front-end Web Dev Bootcamp

## Description

This webpage showcases the Javascript skills I have gained from Module 5 (Intermediate JavaScript) of the Front-end Web Development Bootcamp. 

I have developed a random password based on criteria selected by the user. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the JavaScript code that I have written.

The application has been optimised for viewing across all devices. 

## Usage

1. The **Password Generator** webpage can be accessed online on Github pages: [https://jilloreilly.github.io/password-generator/](https://jilloreilly.github.io/password-generator/
)
2. Click on the "Generate Password" button

3. The user will be prompted to enter a number between 8 and 128 (inclusive)

4. The user will then be asked to confirm whether to include the following character sets for their password:
  - Special characters
  - Numeric characters
  - Uppercase characters
  - Lowercase characters

5. After the user has confirmed the character sets, a randomly generated password (consisting of the character sets chosen) will be printed to the screen.
